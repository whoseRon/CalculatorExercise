## Instructions for running the app

Make sure you have `@angular/cli` installed on your machine.
If not, follow the very simple and straightforward instruction of hot to instal it on [Angular Getting Started](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart).

Now open your terminal, `cd` into the directory in which the project was cloned to, and run `npm i` to run all the project dependencies installation.

After installing all the dependencies, simply run `npm run app`.
That call will open a server and serve the app with the address `http://localhost:3000`.
Now you can open a tab in your browser and navigate to that address.

All native angular files, including app module, components and service can be viewed in `/src/app` folder.
